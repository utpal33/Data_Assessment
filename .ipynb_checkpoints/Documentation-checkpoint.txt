        2.> The 'Person Zip Code' column contained a mix of 5-digit ZIP codes and extended ZIP+4 codes in the format 12345-2345. 
        3.> most of the 'Job Title' column entries have Title with descriptors. might cause inconsistency while filtering or analysing the data according to the job Title
        4.> 'LinkdIn Profile Url' column has Missing values
        5.> 'company HQ Phone', 'Direct Phone Number' and 'Mobile Phone' has some entries not in US NUmber Format (XXX)YYY-ZZZZ. migh cause problem while searching particular data

Handeling Issue : 
        01.> drop the row with df.drop(how='all') - it deleted the row in which all column is empty
        02.> iterate over column with apply() then split the data with '-' the take 0th index value
        03.> iterate over column with apply() then split with comma(,) as it has job title before comma, and take the 0th indexed value.
        04.> filled with 'not filled' value as its a unique value for each business
        05.> 1st approach :- replaced with empty string to merge all the values in one column. (did in this approach)
             2nd approach :- replace with np.nan value and then can be filled values with fillna(method='bfill'/'ffill')
        06 & 07.> as 'null' values are not redable as nan so reo=place null with '' to merge all Number and Email inone column
        08.> split with ext then took 0th value to extract the number
        09.> drop those rows which has same website name using drop method
                # chose this Website column to remove duplicate data as it has the least missing values and each busiiness must have unique website.

## as most of the columns have unique values so it migh mbe inappropriate to filled with statistical measures like mean, median, mode.
## it harm the business while connecting with them.
